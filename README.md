# React Native RevenueCat Integration

This repository demonstrates how to integrate RevenueCat into a React Native application for managing in-app purchases and subscriptions.

## Prerequisites

Before integrating RevenueCat into your React Native project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- npm or Yarn
- React Native CLI
- Xcode (for iOS development)
- Android Studio (for Android development)

## Installation

To integrate RevenueCat into your React Native project, follow these steps:

1. Install the React Native RevenueCat package via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install react-native-purchases
```

or

```bash
yarn add react-native-purchases
```

2. Link the native dependencies:

```bash
react-native link react-native-purchases
```

3. Install the CocoaPods dependencies (for iOS):

```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

4. Ensure you have correctly set up your project for iOS and Android development by following the [official documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

## Configuration

Before using RevenueCat, you need to configure your application on the RevenueCat dashboard. Follow these steps:

1. Sign up or log in to your [RevenueCat account](https://www.revenuecat.com/).

2. Create a new application for your React Native project.

3. Retrieve your `API Key` and `App User ID` from the RevenueCat dashboard.

4. Configure your React Native project by initializing RevenueCat with your API key. This usually involves calling `setupPurchases` with your API key in your application's entry point (e.g., `App.js`).

```javascript
import { Purchases } from 'react-native-purchases';

Purchases.setup("YOUR_API_KEY");
```

## Usage

With RevenueCat integrated and configured, you can start managing in-app purchases and subscriptions in your React Native application.

Here's a simple example of how to make a purchase:

```javascript
import { Purchases } from 'react-native-purchases';

// To make a purchase
Purchases.makePurchase("PRODUCT_IDENTIFIER").then(purchase => {
  // Handle successful purchase
}).catch(error => {
  // Handle purchase failure
});
```

For more detailed usage instructions and API references, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.revenuecat.com/).
